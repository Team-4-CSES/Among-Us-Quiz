# Among-Us-Quiz

Instructions:

Clone this repository onto your local machine.

Run the command "npm install". (If you don't have npm, just google how to get it up and running).

Type "npm start". This should start the website at "http://localhost:3000. It will not open automatically. I'm not sure how to get that working, but until then, just open it manually in your browser.


Website TODO:

1. Use Node.js

The server currently runs with webpack-dev-server. This is a temporary solution, but we do want this site running on Node.js eventually.

2. Create the basic components

3. Set up a backend??

We might just be using a google form to input the questions, but this should only be a temporary solution while we learn how to set up a full website stack.
